        The computer is built! I am very pleased with the result and I was proud of my ability to restrain myself from buying the shiniest and fastest components. The assembly of the computer itself was not nearly as difficult as I imagined it would be, it's just expensive legos but even more fool-proof. The most arduous leg of the desktop construction journey was installing Windows. I had bought a CD of the OS but of course did not have a CD drive. So I tried to bootload a USB with the data using my Mac and just could not get it to boot up. I ended up bricking two USB sticks and finally I gave in and bought an external CD drive. Despite that finally working, my machine had no Wifi drivers so Windows could not install as it requires an internet connection to download all of its "security" and "experiences" (i.e. spyware and ads). But, a few queries to ChatGPT on how to force open the command prompt during the Windows install allowed me to dive deep into the bowels of the file system and run the driver setup executable. Quite the experience. Now I have a $1300 World of Warcraft machine.

        I've begun my Spanish journey. I tried my hand at a game-ified language learning app Mango (similar to Duolingo) but I just get so bored so easily. Luckily I found Language Transfer which is a 90 episode conversation between a Spanish teacher and a student where all the conventions of "learning" go out the window. No memorization or quizes, just exposure. And I've learned a lot! The approach is to focus on the huge amount of overlap between English and Spanish &mdash; the fact that both are Latin derived languages and build from there. I've also started listening to a Spanish podcast No Hay Tos which is just two bros <i>güeyes</i> chatting. Normal conversation! Hard to follow but I am treating this immersively and am assuming that at some point it's all just going to click.

        I've gone to IffyBooks twice now, once to learn how to solder and again to learn how to pick locks. Fun, nerdy. Maybe I'll go back.

        And I am still running and reading. Pushing to get up to longer than 10 miles for my usual weekend runs and trying my damnedest to finish Words of Radiance.

        We began this year traveling back from a week-long trip to Maui. The time in the tropical sun was wonderful. We especially enjoyed snorkeling, swimming through the beautiful fish, and being out on the water with enormous humpback whales.

        Getting back into the fray, I spent significant time combing through this digital garden, cleaning up pages and refining Astrea.

        This year I have several goals that I am particularly excited about:
        <ul>
            <li>Building a computer &mdash; I want to be able to play games regularly with my brother. My hope is this will be an effective (albeit expensive) framework for feeding my social circle.</li>
            <li>Attending <a href='https://iffybooks.net/'>Iffy Books</a> meetups &mdash; Iffy Books is a wonderfully nerdy shop in Philadelphia and I'm excited to get back into learning mini life skills like electronics, lockpicking, and first aid.</li>
            <li>Learn Spanish &mdash; In preparation for a trip to Mexico City.</li>
            <li>Run a half-marathon &mdash; I've signed up for an all-trail event to take place in the Wissahickon Valley.</li>
        </ul>
