<h2>The Digital Garden of S. C. Lewis</h2>
<p>This is a collection of my interests, hobbies, thoughts, and musings.</p>
<p>Like a garden, everything you see was placed there by my hand, though many of these things originate from extraordinary people like <a href="https://www.ashleylian.com/">Ashley Lian</a> who's eclipse photography is featured on every page of this site other than this one. I have written this website and its assembler from scratch. This garden is tended regularly, the most recent changes and life updates are described <a href="./changes.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Please browse and enjoy.</p>
