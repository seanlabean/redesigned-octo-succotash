<h2>The Digital Garden of S. C. Lewis</h2>
<p>This is a collection of my interests, hobbies, thoughts, and musings.</p>
<p>I have written this website and its assembler from scratch. Like a garden, everything you see was placed there by my hand, though many of these things are inspired by <a href="./people.html">extraordinary people</a>.</p> 
<p>This garden is tended regularly, the most recent changes and life updates are described <a href="./changes.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Please browse and enjoy.</p>
