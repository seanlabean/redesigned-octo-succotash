<h2>The Digital Garden of S. C. Lewis</h2>
<p>This is a collection of my interests, hobbies, thoughts, and musings.</p>
<p>Like a garden, everything you see has originated from my hand. I have written this website and its assembler from scratch. It's tended regularly, the most recent changes are described <a href="./changes.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Please browse and enjoy.</p>
