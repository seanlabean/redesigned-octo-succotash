        We began this year traveling back from a week-long trip to Maui. The time in the tropical sun was wonderful. We especially enjoyed snorkeling, swimming through the beautiful fish, and being out on the water with enormous humpback whales.

        Getting back into the fray, I spent significant time combing through this digital garden, cleaning up pages and refining Astrea.

        This year I have several goals that I am particularly excited about:
        <ul>
            <li>Building a computer &mdash; I want to be able to play games regularly with my brother. My hope is this will be an effective (albeit expensive) framework for feeding my social circle.</li>
            <li>Attending <a href='https://iffybooks.net/'>Iffy Books</a> meetups &mdash; Iffy Books is a wonderfully nerdy shop in Philadelphia and I'm excited to get back into learning mini life skills like electronics, lockpicking, and first aid.</li>
            <li>Learn Spanish &mdash; In preparation for a trip to Mexico City.</li>
            <li>Run a half-marathon &mdash; I've signed up for an all-trail event to take place in the Wissahickon Valley.</li>
        </ul>
