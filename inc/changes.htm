<h3>03A</h3>

        A slow and sicky start to the year. Not a whole lot going on yet but I am excited to reset my priorities and start the year off with some intention. I've started using a wider array of the 100r/Varvara ecosystem, specifically Noodle for 1-bit drawings. I find it quite relaxing to draw something simple and am amazed at the level of artistry that exists in the 1-bit space. Some absolutely incredible pieces are out there in addition to seemingly endless possibilities for simple characters and icons. I can't wait to keep exploring. I've started making a map of an imaginary world as well which has been a lot of fun. I'll share it here on the wiki once I have some backstories written up.

        Otherwise, I have been forcing myself to engage in the somewhat intimidating world of Linux. Installing packages and such is easy enough, but I recently had to do something that would have paralyzed me a few years ago: installing printer drivers. I didn't know what a driver was, why it was important, or what to do with it. Why can't I just plug a printer in and just print something?? I'm proud of myself though, I did the research and figured it out, and now I look back at my confused self and feel great knowing it was so easy to break out of that paralysis.

        I purchased a suit for our upcoming wedding we are attending in Puerto Rico. I need to find a tailor next.
