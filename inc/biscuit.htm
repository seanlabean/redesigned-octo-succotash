        For several years I have added to <i>slewis.wiki</i> with the intention of using almost entirely html and css with as little javascript as possible in order to convey information with the most efficient idea/Watt ratio possible. These days if you want to look at a recipe for chocolate chip cookies, you are forced to download hundreds of megabytes of personalized adds, and scipts for popups and dialog boxes; a disgustingly large amount of bloat. If you are unfortunate enough to have a suboptimal internet connection, you wont be making cookies anytime soon. Websites sadly have no need to be "skinny". For the most part, a 200MB page loads fast enough for most people. But what a waste it is.

        My website is easy to load, the biggest loads are the images whose sources I scale down to be less than a megabyte each at maximum. Most are a few dozen kilobytes. But even still, you have to access my website through a browser app (most likely Chrome) which yet again forces you to consume mountains of data whether you ask it to or not. Somehow, a single page of my website that is 2kB of html and css text consumes 200MB of memory in Chrome. I don't like that.

        <code>BISCUIT</code> in a way is a throwback to the old internet. There is no built-in search engine, you have to know the website address ahead of time. There's no javascript execution, (currently) no image rendering, and much much more (less?). I hope that in some strange way people will use <code>BISCUIT</code> as a reason to build simple blogs. Places and pages for simple text, shareable quickly and cleanly in the most efficient way possible.

        <code>BISCUIT</code> is in its very early stages, there's several more things I want to add to it. If you like what you see, please feel free to fork and contribute. &mdash; <a href="https://github.com/seanlabean/PythonProjects/tree/master/Biscuit">Github</a>
