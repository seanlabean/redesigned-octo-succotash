<p>My name is Sean Lewis. I am originally from Sunnyvale, California and moved to Philadelphia in 2017 to pursue my dream of being an astrophysicist. I have worked as a computational astrophysicist and Research Fellow at Drexel University where my research focuses on the modeling of star cluster formation. I am extremely proud of my work. I've entirely fulfilled my ambitions of being a scientist and while I still remain a near decades-long member to the American Astronomical Society, I cannot wait to apply the wealth of skills I have developed to more terrestrial endeavors. In addition to my love of astronomy, I love computer science and the intricacies of software development. Hence, after receiving my Ph.D. II've hopped around tiny software companies building software products and tools for corporate customers in the chemical manufacturing and energy production industries.  I enjoy challenging myself and delving deep into concepts I have little knowledge of to see what I can create. Through this effort I have produced numerous projects of which a few I describe in my blog. Otherwise, I love <a href="../site/books.html">reading</a>, <a href="../site/running.html">running</a>, and learning new things.</p>

<p>I received my Ph.D. in Physics in 2023 and my Masters degree in Physics in 2019 from Drexel Univeristy. I received my B.S. in physics at California Polytechnic State University &mdash; San Luis Obispo in 2016.</p>
