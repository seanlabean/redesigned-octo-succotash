<p>My name is Sean Lewis. I am originally from Sunnyvale, California and moved to Philadelphia in 2017 to pursue my dream of being an astrophysicist. I have worked as a computational astrophysicist and Research Fellow at Drexel University where my research focuses on the modeling of star cluster formation. I am extremely proud of my work. I've entirely fulfilled my ambitions of being a scientist and I cannot wait to apply the wealth of skills I have developed to endeavors a bit more local than the cosmos. In addition to my love of astronomy, I love computer science and the intricacies of software development. Hence, after receiving my Ph.D. I joined a software development company in Philadelphia. I enjoy challenging myself and devling deep into concepts I have little knowledge of to see what I can create. Through this effort I have produced numerous projects of which a few I describe in my <a href="./blog/index.html">Blog</a>. Otherwise, I love <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/126213750-sean-lewis">reading</a>, running, and cooking.</p>

<p>I received my Ph.D. and Masters degree in physics from Drexel Univeristy in 2019. Prior to graduate school, I received my B.S. in physics at California Polytechnic State University &mdash; San Luis Obispo in 2016.</p>
