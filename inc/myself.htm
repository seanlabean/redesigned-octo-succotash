Welcome. My name is Sean Lewis. I am originally from Sunnyvale, California and moved to Philadelphia in 2017 to pursue my dream of being an astrophysicist. In addition to my love of <a href="astro.html">astronomy</a>, I enjoy <a href="books.html">reading</a> and <a href="compsci.html">computer science</a>.
</p>
<p>
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at Drexel University where my research focuses on computational astrophysics and the modeling of star cluster formation and developing a novel <a href="voramr.html">software tool</a> to translate data from different astrophysical simulation code bases. I received my Masters degree in physics from Drexel Univeristy in 2019. Prior to graduate school, I received my B.S. in physics at California Polytechnic State University â€” San Luis Obispo in 2016.
