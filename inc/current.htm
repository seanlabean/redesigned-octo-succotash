<h2>Projects I am Thinking About</h2>
<p>
        <li><a href="digital_art.html">Pixel Sorter</a>: I started out a while ago optimizing a pixel sorting algorithm which sorts the pixel of the whole image. I originally wanted to greate a generative art algorithm that sorted pixels in a semi-regular way to make an interesting washed/glitch effect. I couldn't figure out the array slicing at the time but with a little effort I know I can get it.</li>
        <li><a href="biscuit.html">Biscuit</a>: I want to build it out into a much more niche tool as opposed to the "browser but worse" state it's currently in. Something like a configurable web-scraper/summarizer where you can give a set list of websites and maybe it goes and grabs headlines/articles and displays them cleanly and succinctly.</li>
        <li>Ashley Project: super secret Ashley project.</li>
