<h2>Projects I am Thinking About</h2>
<p>
        <li><a href="digital_art.html">Pixel Sorter</a>: I was able to figure out a simple pixel sorter that uses a Sobel filter to define edges within an image, allowing for sub-array sorting. I am pretty pleased with this, but I would like to add a few more layers of functionality to the script and beef it up to something a bit more useable. I call it <a href="https://github.com/seanlabean/sonoshee">sonoshee</a>.</li>
        <li>I purchased a 6 year old ThinkPad and flashed Debian onto it and habe used it as my daily driver for the last week or so now. I've never set up a Linux box before so it will be a fun project to explore.</li>
        <li>Explore <a href="https://github.com/rudyrucker/chaos?tab=readme-ov-file">James Gleick's CHAOS: The Software</a> ideally on the new Linux machine. Write a blog post about how to set it up.</li> 
        <li><a href="https://maude.lcc.uma.es/maude-manual/maude-manual.html">Maude</a> programming language.</li>
        <li>Make my GIMP workbook ebook readable via my Calibre install. Start the GIMP workbook!</li>
        <li>Taking pictures of birds with my Canon.</li>
