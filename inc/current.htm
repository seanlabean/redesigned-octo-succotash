<h2>Projects I am Thinking About</h2>
<p>
        <li><a href="digital_art.html">Pixel Sorter</a>: I was able to figure out a simple pixel sorter that uses a Sobel filter to define edges within an image, allowing for sub-array sorting. I am pretty pleased with this, but I would like to add a few more layers of functionality to the script and beef it up to something a bit more useable. I call it <a href="https://github.com/seanlabean/sonoshee">sonoshee</a>.</li>
        <li>I purchased a 6 year old ThinkPad and want to flash Linux onto it (Manjaro? EndeavorOS?) and use it as my daily driver for as long as I can. I've never set up a Linux box before so it will be a fun project.</li>
        <li>Explore <a href="https://github.com/rudyrucker/chaos?tab=readme-ov-file">James Gleick's CHAOS: The Software</a></li> ideally on the new Linux machine.
