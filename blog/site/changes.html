            Finished <a href="barchives.html">reading</a> N. K. Jemisin's <i>The Fifth Season</i>. Started a few small JavaScript projects following freeCodeCamp's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS4aFq5-91M" target="_out">guide&mdash;YouTube</a>, completed a simple tally tracker and semi-functional BlackJack simulator. I want to expand the simulator to show probabilities of success for hitting/standing on any given hand. JavaScript is fun, I like the interactivity it provides users. Began refactoring <a href="voramr.html">VorAMR</a> to be fully embedded within Torch. Attended the Philadelphia auto show and the Matisse Exhibit at the PMoA.

          <p>The first Letter of this year was jammed packed with travel. Flew in to SFO via SEA early on. California was in the midsts of receiving a year's  worth of rain in a week, never thought I'd spend a week on the golden coast and never see the sun.</p><p>Flew up to the expectedly rainy city SEA for the 241st American Astronomical Society meeting. Second time meeting the nations astronomers and astrophysicists in person, second time in Seattle. It was a pleasure to be around like-minded professionals. I presented my most recent publication on <a href='clusters.html'>early forming massive stars</a> and my novel <a href='voramr.html'>sofware package</a>. It was the largest room and largest audience I have ever encountered as a speaker.</p><p>I also met with my aunt and uncle in Seattle, I had a very pleasant dinner with them and their friends from college Elliot and Loudres Korch. I was reminded how natural it feels to be around family, and how liberating it is to be unjudged thanks to the unbreakable familial bonds.</p><p>Flying home to PHL, my 2300 red-eye flight was canceled on the tarmac, forcing all 250 of us to scramble to a hotel and get a few hours sleep before returning in the moring. Flying will be the end of my sanity, I just know it.</p><p>On the flight hoome, I refactored my <a href="svanne.html">Svanne</a> script to use Python's argparse module and expanded the functionality to convert any date into the format.</p>
