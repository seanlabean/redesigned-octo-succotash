      <h2>Cameras and Their Effect on Painted Lightning</h2>

        Lightning has been etched, sketched, carved, and painted by artists for thousands of years. From Zeus casting bolts on the sides of Greek vases to the Realism painters of the first half of the 19th century to their Impressionist detractors in the latter half.

        What I am interested in this post is the nature of painted lightning, more specifically its structure, its quantitative form and how it has evolved over time. How lightning has been depicted has changed over time, this is of course true of any art as the tides of the collective artistic eye and culture roll in and out. But it is possible that there are pivotal moments in the course of history that irrevocably alter how art is created. Never have those moments been more prevalent than in the last 200 years with the unstoppable sprint of technological development.

        Indeed, this is the case with lightning. In 2018, Hungarian researchers published findings that there exists a statistically significant change in how lightning appears in media before and after the invention of cameras <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.2017.0859" target="_out">Stromp et al. (2018)</a>. The first photograph of lightning is thought be taken by William Jennings in 1882. The photograph was taken from the roof of his rowhome in northeast Philadelphia and after it was published in the Inquirer, Jennings was propelled to relative superstardum. The subsequent rush to "capture God's signature" resulted in a flurry of scientific proposals and new hypotheses on how lightning forms. But, notably for the art world, lightning was was finally a still subject. No longer would artists be forced to recall flashes from memory, no longer was there an question or doubt as to what lightning truly looked like. This momentary clash between art and technology can even be seen in newspapers from the time, in 1891, a journalist wrote in review of the play <i>Soudan</i>:
        <article>
          “One is never too old to learn, and in this instance the axiom applies to the scene painter who mapped out the tracks of the lightning on the sky that backs the scene used in the second set I recommend the painter consult Mr. Jenning’s scores of instantaneous photographs of thunderbolts in all conceivable poses to correct for the error.”

        A Flash in the Frame: How One Philadelphian Captured an Act of God.

       Lightning is a primordial earthly phenomenon, for billions of years bolts of electricity have streaked down from turbulent storm clouds. Unfathomably enormous electrical discharges, static shocks of planetary proportions, gone in a flash and a rumbling boom. Lightning has long been associated with acts a godlike beings: Thor, Zeus, Xoltl, Chaac, Baal. And understandably so, it must only be a God who has the strength to weild a force so plainly violent and powerful. Then, on the evening of September 2nd 1882, a bolt of lightning arced over the Deleware River just like it had for millenia upon millenia before, but this time was different. This time it was captured. 
       
       On a rain-drenched rooftop in north-Philadelphia sat an Englishman named William Nicholson Jennings, he had taken the very first photograph of lightning.
