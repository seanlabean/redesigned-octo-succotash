      <h2>What is an esolang?</h2>

          An esoteric language is a collection of logically consistent syntax and modes of expression with little to no intended purpose or a purpose so incredibly niche that its usefulness is constrained to the most unique of projects. An esolang that I'm sure nearly everyone is aware of, whether they've realized it or not, is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tengwar" target="_out">Tengwar</a> &mdash; one of Tolkien's Elvish languages and associated script. The language is esoteric in that it serves no purpose other than to give life to one specific ficticious world, and yet it is elegant and beautiful and (most importantly) consistent &mdash; a true language. This type of creativity: the creation of something for a limited but elegant purpose, truly fascinates me.

          But what I am interested here is the creation and use of esoteric languages of the programming variety. Programming languages are different than written or spoken languages in that they only need to effectively and consistently convey commands to a computer, not necessarily to a person. Indeed, some esoteric coding languages are incredibly inconvienient for humans to decipher and others are even optimized to be as difficult as possilbe to read or type. There is a beauty of sorts in these unique and goofy languages, all of which at their core perform simple, cold, logical calculations flipping bits and bytes around, but manage to do so in truly creative ways.

        As with any creative pursuit, it's difficult to pinpoint which esolang was the first to be created, but one of the first was <i>Brainfuck</i> by Urban MÃ¼ller in 1993.
